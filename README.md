# Cadasym

Cadasym is a corpus for Computer Vision of symbols in cadastral maps.

In the 20th century, Swiss land surveyors drew so-called “mutation plans”
whenever a parcel or building changed its geometry. These plans were submitted
to the local governments for approval. This image corpus was built from
scanned mutation plans, owned and archived by the City of Zürich.

To download the corpus, which has been released into the Public Domain,

## Structure

The [released ZIP file](https://github.com/brawer/cadasym/releases/) contains
lots of PNG images. Each image is 256x256 pixel in size, and the symbol is
located at the exact center of the image.
